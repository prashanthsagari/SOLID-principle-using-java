The SOLID principles are a set of five design principles intended to make software designs
more understandable, flexible, and maintainable. 

1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
Principle: A class should have only one reason to change, meaning it should have only one job or responsibility.

2. Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
Principle: Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension but closed for modification.

3. Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
Principle: Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types without altering the correctness of the program.

4. Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
Principle: Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use.

5. Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
Principle: High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions. Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions.
